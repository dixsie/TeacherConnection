## Project Description

This website is a intended for teachers of any grade level and can be broken down into three main sections: meetups, events, and forums. 1) Meetups: are intended for both leisure, learning, and community gatherings. Teachers can connect with other teachers informally for coffee, happy hour, learning events, and more. This section's features include using a search form, filters, maps, and components for results. 2) Events: are collection of formal conferences and other professional development events for a variety of academic areas. This section should include a search form, filters, maps, directions, and a calendar feature. 3) Forums: this section is designed to solve the problem of navigating through dozens of blogs or social media posts, instead teachers can post their questions, resources, and other topics in one main location. This section will be similar to Reddit...but different :)

## User Story 1

Manuela is new to teaching and is not having the best of luck in making teacher friends. She is the youngest teacher at her campus and feels like she has a hard time finding common interests with her coworkers. This website is the perfect solution for her. She is able to create a profile and log in to a website that connects her to trending meetups in her area. She can choose from a menu of interests to help narrow down her search. After a long week of preparing students for state testing, Manuela wants to attend a happy hour with like-minded individuals who understand her work-woes. She can easily use this website to create the meetup and hang out with her future teacher besties.

## User Story 2

 Mr. Smith is the instructional coach at his campus and is responsible for providing teachers with the resources they need to grow professionally. Teachers are required meet a certain number of professional development hours per year and rely on Mr.Smith to point them in the right direction to find courses or events that interest them. Mr. Smith usually spends hours scouring dozens of webpages, blogs, and twitter feeds looking for conferences but has a hard time tracking all of them to share with his campus. Then he found this website! Similar to Eventbrite, he is able to search for events by category and location. He can save events for himself, upload events, or share them with others making his job much easier!
